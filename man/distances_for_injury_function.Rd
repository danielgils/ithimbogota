\title{Get distances and model for injuries module}
\usage{
distances_for_injury_function(trip_scen_sets, dist)
}
\arguments{
\item{trip_scen_sets}{list of synthetic trip sets for scenarios}

\item{dist}{table of (total) distances per mode per scenario}
}
\value{
list of distances, injury table, and injury regression model
}
\description{
Computes exposures (distances) to parametrise the injury regression model, 
which is computed as a Poisson with various offsets and used later in prediction
}
